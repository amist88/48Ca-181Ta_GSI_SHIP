NOTE: These scripts are for illustration puposes and were not used in the data analysis for the results documented in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2019.05.003 . Scripts from the data analysis were done using ROOT/GO4 and OriginLab. 

Simple python scripts written in an interactive Python Notebook (JupyterLab) to plot result data from alpha-decay energy/lifetimes at SHIP. As this is a proof-of-principle example, the scripts are not optimised to be used anywhere except for these datasets. 
Used as an example of dataset-software linking for testing purposes.

The Data to use these scripts on can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10959030 

The scripts can be run using e.g. JupyterLab https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/ and require very few compute resources to process

Requirements: Python 3; Matplotlib
